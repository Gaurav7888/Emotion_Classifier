# Emotion Classifier
The solution should evaluate the caller's voice on live ongoing calls that the caller is attending in the Emergency Response Support System. After studying the caller's voice, the solution should be able to forecast the caller's emotional/mental state. The solution should anticipate/suggest the following information about the caller: it may be a tense voice, a prank call, a drunk voice, an anguished voice, or any other condition which requires an immediate response.
